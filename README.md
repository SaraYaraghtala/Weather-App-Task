## Description

The Weather Web App is a responsive web application that provides users with current weather information for selected cities. It uses the OpenWeather API to retrieve weather data and the IP Stack API to detect the user's location.

### Features

- **City Selection:** Users can choose from a list of predefined cities, including London, Amsterdam, Moscow, New York, and their default home city.

- **Weather Data Display:** The app displays detailed weather information for the selected city, including temperature, current weather icon, weather description, pressure, wind speed, "feels like" temperature, and humidity.

- **Data Refresh:** Users can easily refresh the page to obtain the latest weather data for the selected city.
